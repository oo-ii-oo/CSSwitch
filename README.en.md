## Install and start

You need an Apple Silicon Mac, [Claude Science](https://claude.com/download), and either a third-party model API key or a Codex account.

**Intel Mac source build:** this modified source adds `Build-Intel.command` and
`npm run build:intel` to package an `x86_64` DMG using the existing UI and business
implementation. See [development instructions](./docs/operations/development.md#intel-mac-构建与启动)
for prerequisites and the manual GitHub Actions build. An Intel artifact and
end-to-end runtime acceptance have not yet been established.

1. Download [`CSSwitch_0.8.4_aarch64.dmg`](https://github.com/SuperJJ007/CSSwitch/releases/download/v0.8.4/CSSwitch_0.8.4_aarch64.dmg) and drag CSSwitch into Applications. Optionally verify the public attachment SHA-256 against the [v0.8.4 release evidence](./docs/evidence/releases/v0.8.4.md).
2. Create a profile and enter the API key, model names, and `base_url` when required.
3. Choose **Set active**, then **Start**.
4. Select the model from the model picker at the top of Science.

> The current public package is ad-hoc signed and not Developer ID signed, notarized, or claimed Gatekeeper-accepted. If macOS blocks the first launch, right-click CSSwitch in Finder and choose **Open**.

## Providers and models

- **Built-in providers:** DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Xiaomi MiMo, SiliconFlow, Kimi, MiniMax, OpenRouter, OpenCode Go (OpenAI Chat / Anthropic Messages), Grok (xAI), and Gemini (OpenAI compatible).
- **Custom endpoints:** Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, and OpenAI Responses-compatible APIs. Exact model names can be entered without discovery.
- **Model selection:** A regular profile can use one model for every role, or separate Quality, Balanced, Fast, and Fable models. Science shows the real model name instead of a `default` placeholder.
- **Codex:** Uses a separate CSSwitch browser login and dynamic account catalog. Native `~/.codex` login is never read or modified.

Provider support for tools, thinking, images, long context, and streaming varies. CSSwitch resolves the active catalog strictly; an unknown model is never silently replaced by another model.

## Skills and MCP

The **Skill & MCP** page lists real Skills from the current Science organization, including source and attachment state. It can import local `.zip` and `.skill` packages, while the CSSwitch connector can install a Skill from an exact public GitHub URL.

CSSwitch only manages content it imported. Name conflicts never overwrite existing content, and bundle removal requires whole-bundle confirmation. See the [external Skill bridge](./docs/features/external-skill-bridge.md) for the complete contract.

## Security and isolation

- Third-party mode uses a separate HOME, data directory, and loopback-only Gateway. It does not read or modify real Claude login or Science data.
- API keys stay in local `~/.csswitch/config.json` with `0600` permissions and are not written to logs.
- Official Claude mode stops the third-party proxy path before opening real Science.
- CSSwitch does not download or update Claude Science. New launches prefer a locally validated runtime snapshot already downloaded by the official updater, then fall back to the currently installed official app.

## Current boundaries

- The current macOS Apple Silicon release is **v0.8.4**; layered evidence is in the [v0.8.4 release evidence](./docs/evidence/releases/v0.8.4.md). Public desktop builds currently target macOS Apple Silicon only.
- Third-party mode does not grant Anthropic account privileges; hosted MCP services, directory connectors, and some cloud features may be unavailable.
- Codex remains an off-by-default experiment with one browser-authenticated account.
- The Rust Gateway is bundled; no separate Python runtime is required.
- Source/unit, final artifact, installed identity, signing, and live provider/account results are separate evidence layers. A download page or source-gate pass does not prove every real provider, SSH path, or Science domain capability.

For upgrades, rollback, and detailed limitations, see the [project documentation](./docs/README.md). Please report issues through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SuperJJ007/CSSwitch/issues).

## Development

```bash
cd desktop
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Run the complete local gate with:

```bash
GATE_ROOT="$(mktemp -d /private/tmp/csg.XXXXXX)"
chmod 700 "$GATE_ROOT"
bash test/run_all.sh --output-root "$GATE_ROOT"
```
